C.H.A.R.I: A Major Advising Application

Description: This application assists students with major advising needs, registering for courses,
dropping a course, as well as get more information about a course.

Running the Project: This project can be loaded into Visual Studio 2019. The charichatbotseniorproject
folder contains the C# files of the application such as its code and the GUI. The School Database folder
contains the school database with the tables used in the application to retrieve information.

How to Use the Application: Once the application is loaded, you will run the program and the chatbot
will appear. From there you will type the student ID and then what you will need assisitance with then
navigate around the application for further assistance using the menu. To end the chat, you can click 
on 'End' and/or click on the 'X' on the top right to exit the application completely.

Bugs: Still working on the issue of inserting data into the student_future_courses table after
a student registers for a course. At the moment, the query used is not working in inserting
this data.
